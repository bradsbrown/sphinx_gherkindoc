Feature: Testing Sphinx Writer
==============================

    Test the ability to write Gherkin data to a SphinxWriter object

Background: Some requirements for this test
-------------------------------------------

| - Given that this file exists

Scenario: Test a Scenario
-------------------------

.. pull-quote::

    Tagged: quarantined, JIRA-1234

    A scenario is quicker to write than a outline but less robust.

| - Given a test feature
| - When the suite reaches a scenario
| - Then the file is converted into rST

Scenario Outline: Test a Scenario Outline
-----------------------------------------

| - Given I put **\<thing\>** in a blender
| - When I turn the blender on
| - Then it should transform into **\<other thing\>**

Examples: Fruit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. csv-table::
    :header: "thing", "other thing"
    :quote: “

    “apple“, “apple sauce“
    “banana“, “smoothie“

Scenario: Text and Table Scenario
---------------------------------

    Test the additional options for a scenario

| - Given step text

::

    Lorum ipsum solor sit amet.

| - When the suite reaches a scenario table

    .. csv-table::
        :header: "name", "department"
        :quote: “

        “Barry“, “Beer Cans“
        “Pudey“, “Silly Walks“
        “Two-Lumps“, “Silly Walks“

| - Then the file is converted into rST

Scenario: Normal scenarios with add on steps (And, But) have those add on steps indented
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

| - Given something not indented
|  And something else that IS indented
| - When something not indented happens
| - Then something not indented happened
|  And something indented also happened
|  And another indented thing happened

Scenario: Indentation is ignored when any step in the scenario has text or a table
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

| - Given a step with some text

::

    Here be that said text!

| - And an And step with some text too

::

    Hello again!

| - And how about a table in there too

    .. csv-table::
        :header: "position", "name"
        :quote: “

        “first“, “Who“
        “second“, “What“
        “third“, “I don't know“

| - When the fantasy has ended
| - And all the children are gone
| - Then something deep inside me

::

    Helps me to carry on

| - And Encarnaciooooon
| - And doodle-doodle-doodle-doo
