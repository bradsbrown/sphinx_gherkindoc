Feature: Integrated Backgrounds With Unique Format
==================================================

Scenario: First Scenario
------------------------

| - Given a step that is from the background *(Background)*
|  But the step actually appears with the scenario steps in the sphinx docs *(Background)*
| - Given a step that is defined in the scenario
|  And one more for good measure
| - When I use sphinx-gherkindoc with the --integrate-background flag
| - Then the background steps should be integrated with the scenario steps
|  And the background steps should be formatted differently than the regular scenario steps

Scenario: Second Scenario
-------------------------

| - Given a step that is from the background *(Background)*
|  But the step actually appears with the scenario steps in the sphinx docs *(Background)*
| - Given a step from scenario 2 that is defined in the scenario
|  And one more from scenario 2 for good measure
| - When I use sphinx-gherkindoc with the --integrate-background flag
| - Then the background steps should be integrated with the scenario steps
|  And the background steps should be formatted differently than the regular scenario steps
